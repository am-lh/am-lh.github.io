:::



The study of the functioning and dynamics of mudflats, emblematic habitats of estuaries, is at the heart of the Seine-Aval program. The challenges of development and restoration have led to a focus on the estuary sector, where the largest expanses of these environments are found.

To complete this knowledge and gain a more global view of mudflat functioning, the EVEREST project will focus on the lateral mudflats upstream of Tancarville. The monitoring of ecological functions at several of the project's proposed sites is a first step towards understanding the factors governing the functioning of mudflats in this sector. The ultimate aim is to understand the factors that can contribute to the success of a restoration operation in this tidal river environment.

Particular attention will be paid to the Lillebonne site, which recently underwent a restoration operation. The mudflats at Petiville, Le Trait and Oissel will also be investigated to compare their functioning. Benthic communities (macrofauna, micro-phytobenthos) will be characterized and described using functional biodiversity indicators (life trait analysis). Analysis of the environments at each site, and comparisons between sites, will enable us to identify the parameters that explain their specific ecological functioning.
