#read in cities
cities <- read_excel(here("data", "travel_cities.xlsx"))

#add geometries to cities
cities <- cities %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon",
                      "lat"),
            crs = 4326)

cities %>% 
  leaflet() %>%

  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLabels) %>% 
  addMarkers(label = cities$city)
