A meta-analysis was tested as an approach for modelling the effect of bioturbation exerted by the cockle Cerastoderma edule on sediment erobility. Six different erosion flume datasets were collected to ensure a broad range of experimental conditions including bed shear stress, population characteristics, and sediment composition. First, a model was built to describe the biogenic fluff layer created by C. edule activity in relation to (i) bioturbation activity using the population metabolic rate [mW.m-2] as a proxy for faunal metabolic energy, and (ii) the silt content [%] of the sediment. Second, different erosion models were compared by testing parameterization steps incorporating both erosion of the fluff layer and/or mass erosion of the sediment bed. Structural differences in the flumes and in the preparation of samples in the six different datasets makes it difficult to propose a single model that satisfactorily simulates all the data and encompasses both types of subsequent erosion, that of the fluff layer and that of the underlying consolidated bed. However a generic model is proposed for the surficial fluff layer erosion covering a moderate bed range of bed shear stress (&lt;1 Pa). This study shows that including several datasets covering a wide range of environmental conditions is a key to the robustness of this model, and that new insights can be gained by integrating the complexity of sediment features. We expect that this two-part model can be used in broad contexts in terms of cockle populations, estuarine habitats, and climatic conditions and can combined with various hydro-morpho-sedimentary models that include these biological effects.\n\n\n2 Keywords\nCerastoderma edule, erosion, bioturbation, metabolic rate"

A flume experiment was performed in laboratory to measure two bioturbation parameters: i) the fluff layer quantity created by fauna and easily eroded (at low bed shear stress) and ii) the critical threshold of bed shear stress when mass erosion occurs. The design was focused on two main factors: i) a multispecies composition of the biological sample, with two species together (Cerastoderma edule and Macoma balthica; Scrobicularia plana and Hediste diversicolor; Corophium volutator and Peringia ulvae) at 4 different relative densities ii) three levels of temperatures (representative of winter, spring and summer conditions). Pair-wise species assemblages were chosen on the basis of the shared habitat frequently observed in the field. A 3-fold treatment were made with the same individuals: a measurement of oxygen consumption from the biological sample, followed by a bioturbation phase and an erosion measurement in flume. The measure of oxygen consumption confirmed that theoretical metabolic rate was a good way to evaluate the respiration of fauna, independently of the species. The erosion results showed a high variability, but still indicated that the metabolic rate was an interesting descriptor to evaluate bioturbation effect and the related mediation of sediment erodibility, to integrate the effect of the 2 cohabiting species. The fluff layer was positively linked to the metabolic rate, with all duos together, whereas the relationship between critical mass erosion and metabolic rate was negative, showing a global destabilization mediated by the faunal bioturbation. However, there were significant differences of impact depending on the species considered.\n\n\nBioturbation, respirometry, erosion, erodibility, metabolic rate, intertidal, mudflat, estuaries, benthos"

The aim of the present study is to define optimal ecological niches and habitat suitability for the population of the bivalve Cerastoderma edule in the Seine estuary. The method involved applying quantile regression to a 20-year biological dataset at the scale of the estuary, paired with a hydro-morpho-sedimentary model data set validated over a longer period (25 years) also at the scale of the estuary, using 100-m mesh cells. Rather than using the usual linear or B-spline equations previously used in quantile regression, this study chose to describe the biological processes involved in defining an optimal ecological niche the bifactorial gaussian equation. A comparison was made between those three different types of equation (linear, B-spline and Gaussian) in four sets of paired environmental factors: daily maximum current speed & inundation time, daily salinity range & temperature, daily salinity range & bathymetry, mud content & bed shear stress. The non-linear quantile regression with a bifactorial Gaussian equation produced the best description of habitat suitability and optimal niches, at the 95th centile and using the biomass (gAFDW/m²). Daily maximum current speed & inundation time and daily salinity range & temperature were the most pertinent SDMs. The optimal ecological niche for C. edule appeared to be lower intertidal marine areas, with temperate and low dynamic waters, settled in muddy sand sediment. Using this technique, the calculation of optimal niches in the Seine estuary was explored over a period of 25 years and analysed in isolated sectors of the Seine estuary ecosystems and can now be applied in different scenarios related to the global warming. We propose several pertinent models, so that different kinds of prediction can now be choose according to the context.\n\n\nCerastoderma edule, quantile regression, species distribution model, optimum ecological niches, habitat suitability"
