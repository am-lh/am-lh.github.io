The challenges of development and restoration have led to a focus on the estuary sector, where the largest expanses of these environments are found.\nTo complete this knowledge and gain a more global view of mudflat functioning, the EVEREST project will focus on the lateral mudflats upstream of Tancarville. The monitoring of ecological functions at several of the project’s proposed sites is a first step towards understanding the factors governing the functioning of mudflats in this sector. The ultimate aim is to understand the factors that can contribute to the success of a restoration operation in this tidal river environment.\nParticular attention will be paid to the Lillebonne site, which recently underwent a restoration operation. The mudflats at Petiville, Le Trait and Oissel will also be investigated to compare their functioning. Benthic communities (macrofauna, micro-phytobenthos) will be characterized and described using functional biodiversity indicators (life trait analysis). Analysis of the environments at each site, and comparisons between sites, will enable us to identify the parameters that explain their specific ecological functioning.\nProject details"

However, due to complex and often non-linear interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, as well as irregular data distributions, SDMs are notoriously challenging to construct and validate, highlighting the need for continued research and methodological advancements in this active field of study. Quantile regression is a promising statistical technique to improve SDM as it can deal with data heteroskedasticity and provide a description of habitat suitability consistent with Liebig’s Law of the Minimum. The aim of this study is to propose a tool for assessing habitat suitability of an estuary for a species, by defining its optimal ecological niche, which can be used for estuarine management, with a study case of Cerastoderma edule in the Seine estuary. The method involved applying quantile regression to a 20-year biological dataset coupled with a hydro-morpho-sedimentary model data set validated over a 25-year period, both at the scale of the estuary. To account for the complex distributional shapes, this study was carried out comparing three different types of equation (linear, Gaussian and B-spline). On the basis of a preliminary multivariate analysis of the physical descriptors, two models were built representing hydrodynamic, morphodynamical and sedimentary features: daily maximum current speed, inundation time and daily salinity range or mud content as a third predictor. The Gaussian quantile regression produced the best description of the optimal niche, at the 97.5th centile and using the biomass. The optimal ecological niche for C. edule appeared to be lower intertidal marine areas, with low current speed, low salinity fluctuation and a sediment bed composed of muddy sand in the Seine estuary. The calculation of habitat suitability index in this ecosystem was explored over a period of 25 years. The model using daily maximum current speed, inundation time and daily salinity range was also applied to data from the Scheldt basins, to test the reliability of the model, thus demonstrating that the model performs quite well, even though there were some differences of habitat suitability between these estuaries. This approach can allow direct comparisons of SDMs with one single Gaussian model and may offer new perspectives to investigate SDMs on a large scale.\n\nKeywords\n\nCerastoderma edule, quantile regression, species distribution model, optimum ecological niches, habitat suitability, cockle populations, estuaries"

A meta-analysis was tested as an approach for modelling the effect of bioturbation exerted by the cockle Cerastoderma edule on sediment erodibility. Six different erosion flume datasets were collected to ensure a broad range of experimental conditions including bed shear stress, population characteristics, and sediment composition. First, a model was built to describe the biogenic fluff layer created by C. edule activity in relation to (i) bioturbation activity using the population metabolic rate [mW.m-2] as a proxy for faunal metabolic energy, and (ii) the silt content [%] of the sediment. Second, different erosion models were compared by testing parameterization steps incorporating both erosion of the fluff layer and/or mass erosion of the sediment bed. Structural differences in the flumes and in the preparation of samples in the six different datasets makes it difficult to propose a single model that satisfactorily simulates all the data and encompasses both types of subsequent erosion, that of the fluff layer and that of the underlying consolidated bed. However, a generic model is proposed for the surficial fluff layer erosion covering a moderate range of bed shear stress (&lt;1 Pa). This study shows that including several datasets covering a wide range of environmental conditions is a key to the robustness of this model, and that new insights can be gained by integrating the complexity of sediment features. We expect that this two-part model can be used in broad contexts in terms of cockle populations, estuarine habitats, and climatic conditions and can combined with various hydro-morpho-sedimentary models that include these biological effects\n\nKeywords\n\nCerastoderma edule, erosion, bioturbation, metabolic rate"

However, modelling at large spatial and temporal scales remains a challenge because of the need to consider the fauna at the community level, and because animal behaviour is highly seasonal with non-linear effects of macrofauna functional trait interactions. Bioturbation processes can be linked to the activity of organisms, based on the principle of energy ecology, linking the metabolic rate to the erodibility of a sediment colonised by benthic fauna. This study investigates this postulate by evaluating the erodibility parameters of a sediment subjected to: i) the bioturbation under seasonal temperature variations; ii) the synergistic bioturbation of different species. The experimental design consisted of: i) three temperature levels (winter, spring and summer), ii) three types of species duos (Cerastoderma edule and Macoma balthica; Scrobicularia plana and Hediste diversicolor; Corophium volutator and Peringia ulvae) at 4 different relative densities. Two successive experiments were carried out on the same individuals: measurement of oxygen consumption of fauna then measurement of the erodibility of the colonised sediment in a flume. The oxygen consumption confirmed that the metabolic rate is a good model of the fauna respiration, regardless of species. The erosion results indicated that the metabolic rate in the case of the fluff layer resuspension is an interesting descriptor for 1) the assessment of the bioturbation under variable temperatures and 2) the integration of the two different bioturbator species that could co-occur in the same habitat. In contrast, the effect of bioturbation on the mass sediment erosion threshold cannot be easily modelled by using the metabolic rate and the classification in functional groups is required. Bioturbation models of the fluff layer using metabolic rate is a promising tool for modelling the effects of faunal communities on sediment transport at the scale of an estuary and over the long term, even projected in the context of global warming.\n\nKeywords\n\nBioturbation, respirometry, erosion, erodibility, metabolic rate, intertidal, mudflat, estuaries, benthos"
